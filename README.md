### Everyday Tools

* [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/)

* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* [Git + GitHub.com + GitHubDesktop](https://github.blog/2019-10-02-get-started-easier-with-github-desktop-2-2/)

### Steps to submit via GitHub+Canvas

  1. Make a folder in your GitHub private class repository named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/lc/pattern, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (code+documentation) into the assignment repository folder
  3. Submit the link for the assignment repository folder in Canvas

### Documentation outline
- always in Markdown as a .md file
- what you did
- how you did it
- the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
- how you overcame them
- *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
    - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
    - Other folks' GitHub public repositories and [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are the best places to go for help most of the time
- Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
- For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.

## Policies
### Communication
- This is an equitable learning environment.
	- Problem-solve constructively with respectful language;
	- Be patient with yourselves and others (especially when mistakes are made);
	- Never posture/pose/attitudinize;
	- Always speak up and admit when you do not understand something.
- When you email me, please let me know what class/section you're in.
- The best way to communicate with me outside of class is *always* to make an appointment with me in my office hour.
- I don't answer emails that can be answered with a one-step Google search (i.e. “How do I change the timezone on my Google Calendar?”).
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- I don't answer emails evenings or weekends.
- In an emergency, please call me.
