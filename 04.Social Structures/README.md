# Group Project

# Strategies

## Time Sharing
  - synchronos vs asynchronos?
  - how synchronos?

## Environment Sharing
  - Same computer language?
  - Same sonic language?
  - Same synths? audio?

## Code Sharing
  - Will you play each others' code/instruments?

## Access Control
  - who will have access to what control, when?

## Communication Facilitation
  - Real-time:
    - Chat
    - Graphical User Interface
  - Through-composed:
    - Exquisite Corpse
    - Feedback Systems
    - Timed Systems
  - Semi-composed:
    - Process Score
    - Graphic Score

## LOTS OF LISTENING

## [a previous bno "score"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBJTTdSAHR4)

## a demo "score"
- [based on this improvisation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJVLkeScwik)
- one person does melody/beats, other person does noise.
- structural sections marked by code that looks kind of like this:

`
-noise. something *like*:

`s "hctt*8" # n (irand 56) # speed "[1 |0.5| 0.25]"`

-phrygian. something *like*:

`note (scale "phrygian" "[0 4 2 6] [5 1 ~ [3 2 1]]") # s "2600short" # n (irand 28)`

-arp, then arp+noise. something *like*:

`stack [
s "hctt*8" # n (irand 56) # speed "[1 |0.5| 0.25]",
note (arp "pinkydown" "<e'min69 e'minor6>") # s "arp2600short"]`

-aeolian with a related pattern to the phrygian section. something *like*:

`note (scale "aeolian" "[0 4 2 6] [5 1 ~ [3 2 1]]") # s "arp2600short" # n (irand 28)`
`
