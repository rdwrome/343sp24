# The Life of Live Coding

## Where we're coming from
- [League of Automatic Music Composers 1980 - Later Became The Hub](https://acousmata.com/post/893801464/martian-folk-music)

## DTR: Live Coding
- An approach to creative practice
- Improviser makes art by re-writing rules (mostly computer programs, but sometimes other code) in real-time
  - Audio - Visual Digital media (mostly)
  - Dance, Poetry, Lighting design (more and more)
- With <3 to controllerism, this is not controllerism
  - When we re-write the rules, we change their fundamental character, not just their behavoir
    - Like adapting a recipe with different ingredients vs adjusting serving size
  - If controller and sound source are divorced, how the rules are being re-written in real-time is obscured
  - Chaos reigns, not control!

## Ethos
- Luthier/developer/backend, performer/musician/frontend roles blurred/blended = Distributed Agency
- Anti-hierarchical
- Relatively low barriers to access (FOSS technologies)
  - Economically accessible ("The Laptop is the Guitar of the 21st Century" - Fred Frith)
  - Pedagogically accessible (with many, many caveats)
- TOPLAP (virtual gatheringplace for livecoders) MANIFESTO (the Rachel edit):
* Give us access to the performer’s mind, to the whole human instrument.
* Obscurantism is dangerous. Show us your screens…
* Embrace error, risk is the way to go. Live coding embraces worst practices.
* Code is an interface to oneself, and the self is an interface to culture. To code is to decode.
* Programming and programmer are both part of the runtime environment.
* We weave expression through algorithms that thrive in uncertainty.
* To hack is to play seriously. Rules are good because they can be changed.

## Who am I?
- Improviser (hornist with sf nowave, sludge bands after conservatory)
- Came to technology through an interest information accessibility (adult literacy tutor, public and prison librarian)
- <3 for Network Music and its anti-hierarchical structures
- mind blown by early [PLORK](http://plork.deptcpanel.princeton.edu/listen/NYC/), late [The HUB](http://crossfade.walkerart.org/brownbischoff/) concerts
- Affords criticality of our relationship to digital capitalism
- Started SuperColliding in 2011, making noise to improvise against on my horn
- Moved Paris in 2015 without my horn, Laptop became my primary instrument
- Joined UK-based offal [orchestra for femmes and laptops] in 2016
- Current solo practice kind of back to 2011 form:
  - Laurie Spiegel: Algorithm as Avatar influential in my thinking
  - Algorithm/Avatar is my improvisational interlocutor whom I'm attempting to reassemble as I go
  - Chaos reigns!
